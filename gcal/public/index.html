            <p class="lead">The astronomical convention is used, i.e. year 0 is 1 BCE, year -1 is 2 BCE, etc.</p>
            <p>Due to the way the common era (a.k.a. Anno Domini) year numbering system works, the year 1 BCE is
                followed directly by 1 CE with no year zero. This makes math hard. As such, the astronomical convention
                of making 1 BCE year 0 and extending this into the past was used.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">What is the J (Julian calendar) date?</h4>
            <p class="lead">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian
                calendar</a> is the predecessor to the Gregorian calendar, originally introduced by Julius Caesar in 46
                BC.</p>
            <p>Julius Caesar (with aid of Sosigenes of Alexandria) introduced this calendar to replace the earlier Roman
                calendar, which required manual addition of leap months to keep it in synchrony with the seasons.
                Unfortunately, it had leap days every four years without question, resulting in the average year
                having 365.25 days. However, the actual tropical year is roughly 365.2422 days, resulting in the Julian
                calendar gaining a day every 129 years. This means that seasons drift, starting earlier and earlier in
                the year.</p>
            <p>In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII decided to fix this drift by reducing the number of leap days, motivated by a
                desire to keep the March equinox on March 21st, since that value was hardcoded in the calculation for
                the date of Easter. To achieve this, he made years divisible by 100 but not by 400 non-leap years,
                resulting in 97 leap years every 400 years, resulting in the Gregorian calendar. To bring the equinox
                back in alignment, October 5th to October 14th in 1582 were deleted. The result is the Gregorian
                calendar.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">How are dates before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar handled?</h4>
            <p class="lead">This version uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar for those dates.</p>
            <p>Since the Gregorian calendar was adopted at different times in different countries, there's no nice way
                of handling the transition. In the future, I might make a version that implements the transition with a
                country selector, but this version will stay proleptic forever.</p>

            <p>The integer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian day (JD) number</a> is the
                continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian period, which is very useful in astronomy and
                in software for calculating durations without worrying about weird calendar issues. In this respect,
                it's very similar to Unix time.</p>
            <p>JD 0 is assigned to the date Monday, January 1, 4713 BCE (Julian) or November 24, 4714 BCE (Gregorian).
                More specifically, if fractional JDs are considered, then the integer value specifically refers to the
                Universal Time noon on that date.</p>
