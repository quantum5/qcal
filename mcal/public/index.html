            <h4 class="card-title">What is this?</h4>
            <p class="lead">This is an attempt to render the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar">Mayan
                calendar</a> in a more familiar &ldquo;monthly&rdquo; calendar format.</p>
            <p>The idea of a monthly calendar is sort of alien to the Maya, who used two cycles to track the date and
                a modified base-20 numbering system to track the exact date:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin"><strong>Tzolkʼin</strong></a>
                    cycle, which is a 260-day cycle based on combining 20 day names with 13 numbers, used for religious
                    and ceremonial events and for divination;
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haab%CA%BC"><strong>Haabʼ</strong></a> cycle, which is a
                    365-day cycle consisting of 18 months of 20 day each, plus 5 days at the end of the year known as
                    the <em>Wayebʼ</em>;
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"><strong>Long
                    Count</strong></a>, a modified base-20 system used to represent the number of days since the
                    mythical date of creation, which is August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or
                    September 6, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar. It is typically represented as five numbers
                    separated by dots, with each number counting from 0 up to 19, except for the second last number,
                    which counts from 0 to 17.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the <em>Haabʼ</em> is the closest equivalent to months in the Mayan system, this calendar
                application is based on the <em>Haabʼ</em>. This poses a problem, as in the Mayan system, the Long Count
                is used to track the absolute date and the cycles of <em>Tzolkʼin</em> and <em>Haabʼ</em> are
                unnumbered. To mitigate this issue, I numbered the <em>Haabʼ</em> cycles, with the date of creation in
                cycle 0.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How does Tzolkʼin work?</h4>
            <p class="lead">The Tzolkʼin is composed from two concurrent cycles&mdash;the number 1 to 13, and a list of
                20 day names.</p>
            <p>The day name are: Imix, Ikʼ, Akʼbʼal, Kʼan, Chikchan, Kimi, Manikʼ, Lamat, Muluk, Ok, Chuwen, Ebʼ, Bʼen,
                Ix, Men, Kibʼ, Kabʼan, Etzʼnabʼ, Kawak, and Ajaw.</p>
            <p>Note that the day name and number cycles are completely independent and advance concurrently. This means
                that 1 Imix is followed by 2 Ikʼ and so on. There is no definite start or end to this cycle, but day
                names repeat every 260 days, which is the least common multiple of 13 and 20.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How does Haabʼ work?</h4>
            <p class="lead">The Haabʼ is a cycle of 18 months of 20 days each, counted from 0 to 19, plus 5 extra days
                at the end of the year called the <em>Wayebʼ</em>.</p>
            <p>The 18 normal months are named Pop, Woʼ, Sip, Sotzʼ, Sek, Xul, Yaxkʼin, Mol, Chʼen, Yax, Sakʼ, Keh, Mak,
                Kʼankʼin, Muwan, Pax, Kʼayabʼ, and Kumkʼu.</p>
            <p>The days of each month are counted from 0. So a year would start at 0 Pop, followed by 1 Pop, etc. The
                month of Pop ends at 19 Pop, which is followed by 0 Woʼ. The pattern continues until 19 Kumkʼu, after
                which we have 0 Wayebʼ. The last day of the year is 4 Wayebʼ.</p>
            <p>Note that in the traditional Mayan system, the Haabʼ cycle repeats, but the iterations (&ldquo;years&rdquo;)
                are <strong>not</strong> numbered. Years were implemented in this version to allow the exact screen to
                be identified.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How do the Haabʼ years work?</h4>
            <p class="lead">In the traditional Mayan calendar, Haabʼ cycles are unnumbered. To help uniquely identify
                every screen, I introduced year numbers, with the date of Mayan creation as &ldquo;year 0.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In my system, the year number increases every time 0 Pop rolls around, with year 0 being defined as the
                year containing Mayan creation date (0.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count). This means that creation happens on 8
                Kumkʼu in year 0, and the year continues until 4 Wayebʼ, after which the date is 0 Pop in year 1.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">What's so special about this version?</h4>
            <p class="lead">Most versions of the calendar floating around doesn't use the original definition above.</p>
            <p>Most versions uses the so-called <em>Romme</em> method for leap years, using the same leap year rules as
                the Gregorian calendar, i.e. every year divisible by four, except century years not divisible by 400.
                This method might make sense, except years 3, 7, and 11 were leap years under the original rules and
                were observed as such in real life, but the <em>Romme</em> method instead makes years 4, 8, 12 leap
                years instead.</p>
            <p>This version uses the original rules. The <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/eph_export.html">JPL's
                DE440 and DE441 ephemerides</a> were used to calculate the exact timings of the autumnal equinoxes
                between the Gregorian years 13201 BCE and 17191 CE (corresponding to the French Republican years -14991
                to 15399). The times were then converted to UT1+00:09:21, the exact local time at the Paris Observatory.
                UT1 was chosen to keep track of the Earth's rotation without having to worry about the issues posed by
                leap seconds in UTC. Note that due to the uncertainty over
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94T_(timekeeping)">ΔT</a> — the difference between UT1 and
                Terrestrial Time (TT) used in the ephemerides — it is theoretically possible for there to be
                inaccuracies when the equinox occurs very close to midnight.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">What are those names above the Gregorian date?</h4>
            <p>Those are the names of the days in the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar#Rural_calendar">rural version of the
                    calendar</a>. This was intended to replace the Catholic Church's calendar of saints, as the French
                Revolution wanted to reduce the influence of the church. Every day of the year has a unique name
                associated with the rural economy and these names are supposed to correspond with the season.</p>
            <p>Every <em>quintidi</em> is named after an animal, every <em>décadi</em> is named after an agricultural
                tool, and the remaining days are named after various plants or produce. The only exception is the winter
                month of Nivôse, which has the remaining days named after minerals.</p>

                    calendar</a> date. This is commonly known as the &ldquo;Mayan calendar.&rdquo; This calendar is not

            <h4 class="card-title">What is decimal time?</h4>
            <p class="lead">Decimal time is a time system used during the French Revolution that divided the day into 10
                hours, each with 100 minutes, which contained 100 seconds each.</p>
            <p>The result is 100,000 seconds in one day, compared to the 86,400 seconds with the normal 24-hour
                system. This makes it very easy to denote time as a decimal fraction of a day. For example, decimal time
                5:67:72 (around 13:37:31) on January 1, 2000 can be represented as <code>2000-01-01.56772</code>.</p>
            <p>Also note that each decimal hour is 2.4 normal hours, each decimal minute is 1.44 normal minutes, and
                each decimal second is 0.864 normal seconds.</p>
