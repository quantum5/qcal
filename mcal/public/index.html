            <h4 class="card-title">What is this?</h4>
            <p class="lead">This is an attempt to render the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar">Mayan
                calendar</a> in a more familiar &ldquo;monthly&rdquo; calendar format.</p>
            <p>The idea of a monthly calendar is sort of alien to the Maya, who used two cycles to track the date and
                a modified base-20 numbering system to track the exact date:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin"><strong>Tzolkʼin</strong></a>
                    cycle, which is a 260-day cycle based on combining 20 day names with 13 numbers, used for religious
                    and ceremonial events and for divination;
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haab%CA%BC"><strong>Haabʼ</strong></a> cycle, which is a
                    365-day cycle consisting of 18 months of 20 day each, plus 5 days at the end of the year known as
                    the <em>Wayebʼ</em>;
                </li>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"><strong>Long
                    Count</strong></a>, represents the absolute number of days since the Mayan date of creation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the <em>Haabʼ</em> is the closest equivalent to months in the Mayan system, this calendar
                application is based on the <em>Haabʼ</em>. This poses a problem, as in the Mayan system, the Long Count
                is used to track the absolute date and the cycles of <em>Tzolkʼin</em> and <em>Haabʼ</em> are
                unnumbered. To mitigate this issue, I numbered the <em>Haabʼ</em> cycles, with the date of creation in
                cycle 0.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How does Tzolkʼin work?</h4>
            <p class="lead">The Tzolkʼin is composed from two concurrent cycles&mdash;the number 1 to 13, and a list of
                20 day names.</p>
            <p>The day name are: Imix, Ikʼ, Akʼbʼal, Kʼan, Chikchan, Kimi, Manikʼ, Lamat, Muluk, Ok, Chuwen, Ebʼ, Bʼen,
                Ix, Men, Kibʼ, Kabʼan, Etzʼnabʼ, Kawak, and Ajaw.</p>
            <p>Note that the day name and number cycles are completely independent and advance concurrently. This means
                that 1 Imix is followed by 2 Ikʼ and so on. There is no definite start or end to this cycle, but day
                names repeat every 260 days, which is the least common multiple of 13 and 20.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How does Haabʼ work?</h4>
            <p class="lead">The Haabʼ is a cycle of 18 months of 20 days each, counted from 0 to 19, plus 5 extra days
                at the end of the year called the <em>Wayebʼ</em>.</p>
            <p>The 18 normal months are named Pop, Woʼ, Sip, Sotzʼ, Sek, Xul, Yaxkʼin, Mol, Chʼen, Yax, Sakʼ, Keh, Mak,
                Kʼankʼin, Muwan, Pax, Kʼayabʼ, and Kumkʼu.</p>
            <p>The days of each month are counted from 0. So a year would start at 0 Pop, followed by 1 Pop, etc. The
                month of Pop ends at 19 Pop, which is followed by 0 Woʼ. The pattern continues until 19 Kumkʼu, after
                which we have 0 Wayebʼ. The last day of the year is 4 Wayebʼ.</p>
            <p>Note that in the traditional Mayan system, the Haabʼ cycle repeats, but the iterations (&ldquo;years&rdquo;)
                are <strong>not</strong> numbered. Years were implemented in this version to allow the exact screen to
                be identified.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How do the Haabʼ years work?</h4>
            <p class="lead">In the traditional Mayan calendar, Haabʼ cycles are unnumbered. To help uniquely identify
                every screen, I introduced year numbers, with the date of Mayan creation as &ldquo;year 0.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In my system, the year number increases every time 0 Pop rolls around, with year 0 being defined as the
                year containing Mayan creation date (0.0.0.0.0 in the Long Count). This means that creation happens on 8
                Kumkʼu in year 0, and the year continues until 4 Wayebʼ, after which the date is 0 Pop in year 1.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4 class="card-title">How does the Long Count work?</h4>
            <p class="lead">The Long Count calendar is a count of days since the Mayan date of creation, which is August
                11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Julian
                calendar.</p>
            <p>It uses a modified base-20 system to represent this number, with each &ldquo;digit&rdquo; counting from 0
                up to 19, except for the second last &ldquo;digit,&rdquo; which counts from 0 to 17. Typically, five
                numbers are shown, separated by dots, but in theory, more numbers could be used for dates in the distant
                future.</p>
            <p>For example, the date 13.0.0.0.0 represents exactly 13&times;20&times;20&times;18&times;20 =
                1&thinsp;872&thinsp;000 days since the date of creation, which is December 21, 2012 CE.</p>
            <p>Each &ldquo;digit,&rdquo; of the Long Count have a name, from the rightmost: kʼin, winal, tun, kʼatun,
                bʼakʼtun, piktun, kalabtun, kʼinchiltun, alautun, hablatun. Terms from bʼakʼtun and beyond were invented
                by modern scholars and were not used by the classical Maya.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title">What are the Lords of the Night?</h4>
            <p class="lead">They are nine deities in Mayan mythology who rule over every ninth night and forming a
                cycle.</p>
            <p>The Mayan names for these nine deities were unfortunately lost to history, so they are designated
                numerically from G1 to G9.</p>
            <p>The Aztecs used a similar system with different names, and those names are: Xiuhtecuhtli, Tezcatlipoca,
                Piltzintecuhtli, Centeotl, Mictlantecuhtli, Chalchiuhtlicue, Tlazolteotl, Tepeyollotl, Tlaloc. Since
                this is a Mayan calendar, we will not be using the Aztec names.</p>
